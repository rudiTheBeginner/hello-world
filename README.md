# hello-world
This is my **first repository ever** I am so excited.
I start this journey with little knowledge. If you have a project which suits skills of a beginner, just contact me at rudithebeginner@hotmail.com. I will be happy 😃 to contribute. I took the online course on openHPI 👍 in `R` and am almost through with the `Java` online course. Maybe I will start a `Python` online course soon.
